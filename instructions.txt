For the database, you need to have a MySQL server installed and running on your local device.

to run the modules:

1. cd to the module wanted

2. find either a "index.js" file or a "server.js" file and open it

3. please add you user and password for MySQL

4. run the code in the terminal using 
    node index.js
or  node server.js

5. for in your web-browser
use:                        for:
-----                       ------
localhost:3002              Event Management page
localhost:5001              login page
localhost:5001/register     register page
localhost:5002              User Profile page
localhost:5003              Volunteer History Page

- if there is any problem with running the modules please let us know, because from our end everything works.
